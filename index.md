# The Basic Idea of Models

The physical world is complicated, but humans always find a way to abstract it.

Abstraction is the model. It provides a way to group data, making it easier for humans to communicate with others.

Machine learning is the method for computers to model data, which means abstracting key representations.

The process of creating these models involves labeling massive data, then defining a structure for the machine to learn the potential mathematical functions that represents the data. This allows the model to predict the accurate output given a new input. The higher the accuracy of the prediction, the better the model's performance.
