**Gradient**: A gradient measures how much the output of a function changes if you change the inputs a little bit. It is a vector of partial derivatives with respect to all input variables. Gradients are used in optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the model parameters in the direction that reduces the error.

**Loss Function**: A loss function measures how well a machine learning model's predictions match the actual data. It quantifies the difference between the predicted values and the true values. The goal of training a model is to minimize the loss function, thereby improving the model's accuracy.

**Fine Tune**: Fine-tuning is the process of making small adjustments to a pre-trained machine learning model to adapt it to a specific task or dataset. This involves training the model on a new, often smaller, dataset for a few more epochs, allowing it to learn the nuances of the new data while retaining the general knowledge it acquired during the initial training phase. Fine-tuning is commonly used in transfer learning to improve model performance on specialized tasks.
